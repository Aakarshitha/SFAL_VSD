  <Summary>**Day 2 - Basics of STA**</summary>
    - **Lecture 4 - Intro to STA**
      - Basics of STA concepts were described and learnt in great detail, with examples and diagrams.
    - **Lecture 5 - What are Constraints**
      - Constraints are dicussed and transition time and output loads dicussed. Their impact on STA discussed.
    - **Lecture 6 - Input Trans and Output Load**
      - Basics were discussed how this affects setup and hold, operating frequency etc.
    - **Lab 5 - Timing dot libs**
      - Library files discussed.
