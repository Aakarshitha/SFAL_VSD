Week 7 - Process, Voltage and Temperature Corners with Timing Analysis and Impact on BabySOC

This task involved synthesis, timing analysis and reporting of post synthesis simulations for the multiple corners of Process, Voltage and Temperatures, on VSD BabySOC, using SDC(Synopsys Design Constraints) file, and other stimulus. This is usualyl donein industry with various PVT corners to ensure best operation for the required PPA specifications.
